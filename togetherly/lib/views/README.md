# Views

This folder contains all UI classes. The bulk of these are separated into screens and widgets.
Screens represent pages of the app, while widgets represent components that may be used as part of
various other widgets or pages. Classes at the top level of this directory may implement core
UI-related functionality, such as navigation.
