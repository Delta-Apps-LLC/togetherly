A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Setting Up Environment Variables

To build the project, you must create a ".env" file at the root of the project.
**This file should not be checked into version control.**
It should contain the following environment variables:

```env


```

Once this file has been created and each time it is updated, you must run the
command `flutter run build_runner build` from the root of the project. This will
generate/update the requisite dart files, which have been intentionally excluded
from version control.
